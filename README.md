## Project Overview

  *Mind Over Data* is a Data Science and Advanced Analytics boutique consultancy that operates in cross industries and on different geographies like Europe, Australia and Brazil. This company provides tailor-made Advanced Analytics solutions for companies worldwide. 

  The company's main objectives are understanding the characteristics of each point of sale, perceiving the different types of points of sales, that is, the characteristics that represent them, identifying product preferences, and deploying solutions and strategies for the different findings. This is crucial for doing a 6-week product forecast for each point of sale. 

### Background
